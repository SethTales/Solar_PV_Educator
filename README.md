# Solar_PV_Educator

This application is learning tool for me, as well as the future users. The purpose of the application is to provide a simple, yet informative application to determine the electricity output from a solar photovoltaic array. The application is targeted at residential and small commerical systems, of < 0.5 mW.

Solar PV Educator (final name TBD) will provide a UI for property owners to model different sizes and configurations of their PV system, as well as find local, state and federal incentives programs to lessen the upfront cost of their system. The application will provide monthly and yearly average electricity production amounts, localized by zip code, as well as estimated up-front costs localized by zip code. A simple ROI calculator will show the break-even year, 10-year and 20-year savings.

The application is written using Python3, Flask framework, Jinja2 template engine, HTML, CSS and Javascript. The data regarding solar PV's will be obtained from API's published by NREL.
